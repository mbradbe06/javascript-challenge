Homework #11 - Javascript

UFO Level 1 contains app.js and index.html to run UFO filter code by date

UFO Level 2 contains the same but index.html contains more filters - app.js is a long repetitive code that works with some multi-filter values and works when all fields are input, app1.js is an attempt to shorten code substantially by mapping though have not been successful with the code yet
